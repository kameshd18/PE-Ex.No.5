**Date:**  

**Register Number:** 212222240043

---

## Aim
To **test and compare the performance of different prompting patterns** in AI (broad/unstructured vs. basic/structured) across multiple scenarios.  

**Objectives:**  
- Assess how prompt clarity and structure affect **quality, accuracy, and depth** of AI-generated responses  
- Identify **scenarios where basic prompts significantly outperform naïve prompts**  
- Provide **recommendations for structuring prompts** for optimal results  

---

## AI Tools Required
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5 Mini)**  
- Optional: Claude, Bard, or other AI tools for cross-platform comparison  

---

## Methodology

### 1. Define Prompt Types
- **Naïve / Broad Prompts:**  
  - Short, vague, or general instructions  
  - Low context, often just a topic or task  
  - Example: "Write a story about a hero."  

- **Basic / Structured Prompts:**  
  - Clear, detailed instructions providing **context, constraints, and desired output format**  
  - Example: "Write a 200-word adventure story about a young hero saving a village from a dragon. Include dialogue, describe the setting, and end with a moral lesson."  

---

### 2. Prepare Test Scenarios
Five common AI task scenarios were selected:  
1. **Creative Story Generation**  
2. **Factual Question Answering**  
3. **Article or Concept Summarization**  
4. **Advice / Recommendations**  
5. **Concept Explanation for Beginners**  

**Prompt Examples:**  

| Scenario | Naïve Prompt | Basic Prompt |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Creative Story | "Write a story about a hero." | "Write a 200-word adventure story about a young hero who saves a village from a dragon. Include dialogue and a moral lesson." |
| Factual Question | "Tell me about black holes." | "Explain black holes in 150 words for a high school student. Include formation, properties, and effects on nearby stars." |
| Article Summary | "Summarize this article." | "Summarize this 1000-word article into 5 key points, highlighting main arguments, conclusions, and examples." |
| Advice / Recommendation | "Give career advice." | "Provide career guidance for a 3rd-year engineering student interested in AI/ML, including recommended courses, projects, and skill development tips." |
| Concept Explanation | "Explain quantum computing." | "Explain quantum computing in simple terms for beginners, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, and real-world applications." |

### 3. Experiment Execution
1. Input **Naïve prompts** in ChatGPT and record outputs  
2. Input **Basic prompts** for the same task and record outputs  
3. Capture the following **metrics**:  
   - **Quality**: Coherence, readability, and completeness of response  
   - **Accuracy**: Correctness of information  
   - **Depth**: Level of detail and explanation  
   - **Response time**: Time taken to generate outputs  
   - **Relevance**: Alignment with prompt requirements

### 4. Results & Analysis

| Scenario | Prompt Type | Quality (1–5) | Accuracy (1–5) | Depth (1–5) | Observations |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Creative Story | Naïve | 3 | 4 | 2 | Basic story, lacks dialogue or clear moral |
| Creative Story | Basic | 5 | 5 | 5 | Structured, detailed, with dialogue and lesson |
| Factual Question | Naïve | 3 | 3 | 2 | General facts; missing key details |
| Factual Question | Basic | 5 | 5 | 4 | Complete, detailed, understandable by students |
| Article Summary | Naïve | 2 | 3 | 2 | Too generic, lacks main points |
| Article Summary | Basic | 5 | 5 | 5 | Well-structured summary highlighting key arguments |
| Advice / Recommendation | Naïve | 3 | 3 | 2 | Generic advice without actionable steps |
| Advice / Recommendation | Basic | 5 | 5 | 4 | Targeted, actionable career guidance for AI/ML |
| Concept Explanation | Naïve | 3 | 3 | 2 | Uses technical terms, confusing for beginners |
| Concept Explanation | Basic | 5 | 5 | 5 | Beginner-friendly, includes real-world examples |

---

### 5. Observations
- **Basic prompts consistently outperform naïve prompts** across all metrics  
- **Naïve prompts** may produce rough ideas or general content but are insufficient for detailed explanations  
- Structured prompts improve:  
  - **Coherence**: Well-organized responses  
  - **Clarity**: Easier to understand  
  - **Depth**: Detailed examples, reasoning, and insights  
- Certain scenarios like **creative brainstorming** may tolerate naïve prompts, but **educational or technical tasks** require structured prompts  

---

### 6. Example Outputs

**Scenario: Creative Story**  
- **Naïve Prompt Output:**  
  > "Once there was a hero who went on an adventure. He faced challenges and succeeded."  

- **Basic Prompt Output:**  
  > "In a small village, a young hero named Aryan discovered that a dragon was terrorizing the villagers. With courage and clever planning, Aryan approached the dragon and convinced it to leave peacefully. Dialogue between Aryan and the dragon revealed mutual respect. The village was saved, and the moral learned was that bravery combined with intelligence can resolve conflicts."

---

**Scenario: Factual Question**  
- **Naïve Prompt Output:**  
  > "Black holes are regions in space with strong gravity. They can pull in stars."  

- **Basic Prompt Output:**  
  > "A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. Black holes affect nearby stars and planets through gravitational pull and can emit radiation detectable by astronomers."

### 7. Insights
- **Prompt clarity directly impacts output quality**  
- Structured prompts guide AI to:  
  - Include examples and reasoning  
  - Follow a defined format or word limit  
  - Deliver actionable insights  
- Recommended for **technical, educational, and professional applications**
